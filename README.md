My name is Kayigire Ngabire Kethia,and ðŸŒ± I am a student who is taking my studies of Computer Engineering in Rwanda Coding Academy in Nyabihu.

I am currently specialising in Front End Web Development and Design, though not being a professional one as I am improving from time to time. I learnt HTML,CSS, Javascript, Angular and currently learning C++, Java and React. 

âš¡Outside the technology, I like spending time reading books and trying new skills such as drawing. I get also time to get in touch with friends and family. 

ðŸ˜„ I am really enthusiastic in studying programming. I hope to improve more in this domain of programming through out the journey.
