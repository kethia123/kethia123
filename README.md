ðŸ˜„ My name is Kayigire Ngabire Kethia, and I am a graduate student of Software Engineering and Embedded Systems at Rwanda Coding Academy in Nyabihu.

ðŸ”­ As an enthusiast in arts and design, I strive to bring creativity and flair to different community solutions and create a merge between modern technology and art in our evolving society. I plan to study computer engineering as an undergraduate while continuing in arts, with the goal of making an impact on my community. My leadership and communication skills enhance collaboration, making me a lifelong learner passionate about driving innovation in technology. I am currently specializing in front-end web development and design in Figma, though not a professional one, as I am improving from time to time. I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, C++, and Java. 

âš¡Outside technology, I like spending time reading books and trying new skills such as drawing. I also get time to get in touch with friends and family. I am really enthusiastic about studying programming. I hope to improve more in this domain of programming throughout the journey.
