ðŸ˜„ My name is Kayigire Ngabire Kethia, and I am a graduate student of Software Engineering and Embedded Systems at Rwanda Coding Academy in Nyabihu.

ðŸ”­ I am currently specializing in Front End Web Development and design in Figma, though not a professional one, as I am improving from time to time. I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, C++, and Java. 

ðŸŒ± Currently, I have been learning React and improving my designs. I also hope to be able to enhance my skills in the meantime by challenging myself with different coding exercises and programs.

âš¡Outside technology, I like spending time reading books and trying new skills such as drawing. I also get time to get in touch with friends and family. I am really enthusiastic about studying programming. I hope to improve more in this domain of programming throughout the journey.
