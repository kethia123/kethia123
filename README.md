😄 My name is Kayigire Ngabire Kethia, and I am a student 🌱 of Computer Engineering at Rwanda Coding Academy in Nyabihu.

🔭 I am currently specializing in Front End Web Development and Designing in Figma, though not a professional one as I am improving from time to time. I learned HTML, CSS Javascript, Angular, C++, Java. 

🌱 Currently, I have been learning React and improving my designs. I also hope to be able to enhance my skills in the mean time by challenging myself to different coding exercises and programs.

⚡Outside the technology, I like spending time reading books and trying new skills such as drawing. I also get time to get in touch with friends and family. I am really enthusiastic about studying programming. I hope to improve more in this domain of programming through out the journey.
